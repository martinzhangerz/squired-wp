#Export Data (GDPR)

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an important data privacy regulation that websites must comply with, especially if your website is servicing people from countries in the European Union. It requires companies and site owners to be transparent about how they collect, use, and share personal data. It also gives individuals more access and choice when it comes to how their own personal data is collected, used, and shared. In this tutorial we show you how members can request and download a copy of their personal data.
