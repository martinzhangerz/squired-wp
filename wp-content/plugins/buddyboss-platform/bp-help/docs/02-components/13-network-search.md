#Network Search

Activating and configuring Network Search in the BuddyBoss platform is easy. This allows you to search everything within the network including all BuddyBoss social content and any custom post types, all in an autocomplete drop-down. This is important as the out of the box WordPress search is only going to search through WordPress Pages and Blog Posts.
